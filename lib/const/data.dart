      "The two-pointer technique is a fundamental algorithmic approach that plays a pivotal role in optimizing solutions to specific types of problems in computer science. This strategy involves the use of two pointers, often represented as indices or references, that traverse a data structure, such as an array, list, or string, simultaneously. By manipulating the positions of these two pointers",
